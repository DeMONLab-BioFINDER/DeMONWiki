If you want to learn more about git and github, always recommended to check Git doc and GitHub docs. Majority of this page is from Git doc.\nIntroduction & Setup\n\nWhy version control\nVersion control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For example, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled,\nthough in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.\nIf you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which\nyou would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It\nallows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a\nprevious state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing\na problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if\nyou screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little\noverhead.\nWhy Git\nGit is a free distributed VCS with fast speed and strong support for non-linear development (many branches), which was invented by\nLinus Torvalds for Linux project in 2005.\nGitHub\nGitHub is the single largest host for Git repositories, and is the central point of collaboration for\nmillions of developers and projects. A large percentage of all Git repositories are hosted on GitHub,\nand many open-source projects use it for Git hosting, issue tracking, code review, and other things.\nSo while it’s not a direct part of the Git open source project, there’s a good chance that you’ll want\nor need to interact with GitHub at some point while using Git professionally.\nSetup\nRemote setup\nIn DeMONLab, we used Github as remote repo, you could visit Github to create a account. Once you have your account, you could ask labmates to invite you to join our DeMONLab-BioFINDER organization.\nLocal setup\nMost Linux and Macos machines are installed with git. If you are using Windows (unfortunately), you could download and install git from here.\nAlways recommended to use latest stable version of softwares, for new features and safety reasons.\n\nConfiguration\nOnce you have installed/updated git, you need to setup with your Github  and .\n# If  is AlzheimerDisease and  is ad1901@brain.com\n$ git config --global user.name \"AlzheimerDisease\"\n$ git config --global user.email ad1901@brain.com\n\nDeMONLab Git Workflow\n\nPlease stay tuned.\n\nGit Commands\n\nYou could always check the usage of git commands using git help . For example, you could get the manpage help for the git config command by running this:\n$ git help config\n\nYou could also find in-person help on stack overflow.\nInitializing a repository\nYou could initialize a repo for a existing directory using:\n$ git init \n\nIf you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few git add commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a git commit:\n$ git add .\n$ git add LICENSE\n$ git commit -m 'Initial project version'\nAlternatively, you could clone an existing repo using:\n$ git clone \nIgnoring files\nYou will have a class of files (e.g., .DS_Store from macos) you don't want Git to automatically add/track. In such case, you can create a file listing patterns to match them named .gitignore. Here is an example .gitignore file:\n# An .gitignore example\n\n# ignore all .DS_Store files\n*.DS_Store\n\n# ignore all .a files\n*.a\n# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above\n!lib.a\n\n# only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO\n/TODO\n\n# ignore all files in any directory named build\nbuild/\n\n# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt\ndoc/*.txt\n\n# ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories\ndoc/**/*.pdf\n\nNote that .gitignore works by commands git add .gitignore and git commit -m \"gitignore\". Then git will ignore/untrack these files in future commits.\nIf you want to ignore a file that is already checked in, you must untrack the file before you add a rule to ignore it. From your terminal, untrack the file.\n$ git rm --cached \n\nChecking the status of your files\nThe main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the $ git status command. If you run this command directly after a clone, you should see something like this:\n$ git status\n# On branch main\nnothing to commit (working directory clean)\n\nIf you add a new file (e.g., README file) to your project, and the file didn't exist before, when you run a $ git status you should see your untracked file like this:\n$ git status\n# On branch main\n# Untracked files:\n#   (use \"git add ...\" to include in what will be committed)\n#\n#   README\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n\nStaging files\nAfter initializing a git repository in the chosen directory, all files will now be tracked. Any changes made to any file will be shown after a $ git status as changes not staged for commit.\nTo stage changes for commit you need to add the file(s) - or in other words, stage file(s).\nIn order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command git add. To begin tracking the README file, you can run this:\n$ git add README\n\nIf you run your status command again, you can see that your README file is now tracked and staged to be committed:\n$ git status\n# On branch main\n# Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.\n# Changes to be committed:\n#   (use \"git restore --staged ...\" to unstage)\n#       new file: README\n\nHere are some options of git add command:\n# Adding a file\n$ git add filename\n\n# Adding all files\n$ git add -A\n\n# Adding all files changes in a directory\n$ git add .\n\n# Choosing what changes to add (this will got through all your changes and you can 'Y' or 'N' the changes)\n$ git add -p\n\nViewing your staged/unstaged changes\nIf the git status command is too vague for you — you want to know exactly what you changed, not just which files were changed — you can use the git diff command.\nBasically, git diff answers two questions:\n\nWhat have you changed but not yet staged?\nwhat have you staged that you are about to commit?\n\nLet’s say you edit and stage the README file again and then edit the CONTRIBUTING.md file without staging it. If you run your git status command, you once again see something like this:\n$ git status\n# On branch main\n# Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.\n# Changes to be committed:\n#   (use \"git reset HEAD ...\" to unstage)\n#       modified: README\n# Changes not staged for commit:\n#   (use \"git add ...\" to update what will be committed)\n#   (use \"git checkout -- ...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n#       modified: CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nTo see what you’ve changed but not yet staged, type git diff with no other arguments:\n$ git diff\n# diff --git a/CONTRIBUTING.md b/CONTRIBUTING.md\n# index 8ebb991..643e24f 100644\n# --- a/CONTRIBUTING.md\n# +++ b/CONTRIBUTING.md\n# @@ -65,7 +65,8 @@ branch directly, things can get messy.\n# Please include a nice description of your changes when you submit your PR;\n# if we have to read the whole diff to figure out why you're contributing\n# in the first place, you're less likely to get feedback and have your change\n# -merged in.\n# +merged in.

The result tells you the changes you’ve made that you haven’t yet staged.\nIf you want to see what you’ve staged that will go into your next commit, you can use git diff --staged. This command compares your staged changes to your last commit:\n$ git diff --staged\n# diff --git a/README b/README\n# new file mode 100644\n# index 0000000..03902a1\n# --- /dev/null\n# +++ b/README\n# @@ -0,0 +1 @@\n# +My Project\n\nSome options for git diff:\n# See all (non-staged) changes done to a local repo\n$ git diff\n\n# See all (staged) changes done to a local repo\n$ git diff --cached\n\n# Check what the changes between the files you've committed and your Github repo\n$ git diff --stat origin/main\n\n# Check what the changes between the files you've committed and DeMONLab's repo\n$ git diff --stat upstream/main\n\nCommitting files\nAfter adding/staging a file, the next step is to commit staged file(s) using:\ngit commit\nSome options for git commit:\n# Commit staged file(s)\n$ git commit -m 'commit message'\n\n# Add file and commit\n$ git commit filename -m 'commit message'\n\n# Add file and commit staged file\n$ git commit -am 'insert commit message'\n\n# Amending the last commit\n$ git commit --amend 'new commit message' or no message to maintain previous message\n\n# Squashing commits together\n$ git rebase -i\nThis will give you an interface on your core editor:\n# Commands:\n#  p, pick = use commit\n#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message\n#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending\n#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit\n#  f, fixup = like \"squash\", but discard this commit's log message\n#  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell\n\nRemoving files\nTo remove a file from Git, you have to remove it from your tracked files (more accurately, remove it\nfrom your staging area) and then commit. The git rm command does that, and also removes the file\nfrom your working directory so you don’t see it as an untracked file the next time around.\nIf you simply remove the file from your working directory, it shows up under the “Changes not\nstaged for commit” (that is, unstaged) area of your git status output:\n$ rm PROJECTS.md\n$ git status\n# On branch main\n# Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.\n# Changes not staged for commit:\n#   (use \"git add/rm ...\" to update what will be committed)\n#   (use \"git checkout -- ...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n#       deleted: PROJECTS.md\n# no changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\nThen, if you run git rm, it stages the file’s removal:\n$ git rm PROJECTS.md\nrm 'PROJECTS.md'\n$ git status\n# On branch main\n# Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.\n# Changes to be committed:\n#   (use \"git reset HEAD ...\" to unstage)\n#       deleted: PROJECTS.md\n\nThe next time you commit, the file will be gone and no longer tracked. If you modified the file or\nhad already added it to the staging area, you must force the removal with the -f option. This is a\nsafety feature to prevent accidental removal of data that hasn’t yet been recorded in a snapshot and\nthat can’t be recovered from Git.\nAnother useful thing you may want to do is to keep the file in your working tree but remove it from\nyour staging area. In other words, you may want to keep the file on your hard drive but not have\nGit track it anymore. This is particularly useful if you forgot to add something to your .gitignore\nfile and accidentally staged it, like a large log file or a bunch of .a compiled files. To do this, use the\n--cached option:\n$ git rm --cached README\n\nViewing the Commit History\nAfter you have created several commits, or if you have cloned a repository with an existing commit\nhistory, you’ll probably want to look back to see what has happened. The most basic and powerful\ntool to do this is the git log command.\n# Show a list of all commits in a repository. This command shows everything about a commit, such as commit ID, author, date and commit message.\n$ git log\n\n# List of commits showing commit messages and changes\n$ git log -p\n\n# List of commits with the particular expression you are looking for\n$ git log -S 'something'\n\n# List of commits by author\n$ git log --author 'Author Name'\n\n# Show a list of commits in a repository in a more summarised way. This shows a shorter version of the commit ID and the commit message.\n$ git log --oneline\n\n# Show a list of commits in a repository since yesterday\n$ git log --since=yesterday\n\n# Shows log by author and searching for specific term inside the commit message\n$ git log --grep \"term\" --author \"name\"\n\nUndoing Things\nAt any stage, you may want to undo something. Here, we’ll review a few basic tools for undoing\nchanges that you’ve made. Be careful, because you can’t always undo some of these undos. This is\none of the few areas in Git where you may lose some work if you do it wrong.\n\nAmending commit\nOne of the common undos takes place when you commit too early and possibly forget to add some\nfiles, or you mess up your commit message. If you want to redo that commit, make the additional\nchanges you forgot, stage them, and commit again using the --amend option:\n$ git commit --amend\n\nAs an example, if you commit and then realize you forgot to stage the changes in a file you wanted\nto add to this commit, you can do something like this:\n$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'\n$ git add forgotten_file\n$ git commit --amend\n\nOnly amend commits that are still local and have not been pushed somewhere.\nAmending previously pushed commits and force pushing the branch will cause\nproblems for your collaborators.\n\nUnstaging a staged file\nFor example, let’s say you’ve changed two files and\nwant to commit them as two separate changes, but you accidentally type git add * and stage them\nboth. How can you unstage one of the two? The git status command reminds you:\n$ git add *\n$ git status\n# On branch main\n# Changes to be committed:\n#   (use \"git reset HEAD ...\" to unstage)\n#       renamed: README.md -> README\n#       modified: CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nRight below the “Changes to be committed” text, it says use git reset HEAD … to unstage. So,\nlet’s use that advice to unstage the CONTRIBUTING.md file:\n$ git reset HEAD CONTRIBUTING.md\n# Unstaged changes after reset:\n# M CONTRIBUTING.md\n$ git status\n# On branch main\n# Changes to be committed:\n#   (use \"git reset HEAD ...\" to unstage)\n#       renamed: README.md -> README\n# Changes not staged for commit:\n#   (use \"git add ...\" to update what will be committed)\n#   (use \"git checkout -- ...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n#       modified: CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nThe command is a bit strange, but it works. The CONTRIBUTING.md file is modified but once again\nunstaged.\nIt’s true that git reset can be a dangerous command, especially if you provide the\n--hard flag. However, in the scenario described above, the file in your working\ndirectory is not touched, so it’s relatively safe\n\nSome options for git reset commands:\n# Mixes your head with a give sha\n# This lets you do things like split a commit\n$ git reset --mixed [sha]\n\n# Upstream main\n$ git reset HEAD upstream/main -- filename\n\n# The version from the most recent commit\n$ git reset HEAD -- filename\n\n# The version before the most recent commit\n$ git reset HEAD^ -- filename\n\n# Move head to specific commit\n$ git reset --hard sha\n\n# Reset the staging area and the working directory to match the most recent commit. In addition to unstaging changes, the --hard flag tells Git to overwrite all changes in the working directory, too.\n$ git reset --hard\n\nUnmodifying a Modified File\nWhat if you realize that you don’t want to keep your changes to the CONTRIBUTING.md file? How can\nyou easily unmodify it — revert it back to what it looked like when you last committed (or initially\ncloned, or however you got it into your working directory)? Luckily, git status tells you how to do\nthat, too. In the last example output, the unstaged area looks like this:\n# Changes not staged for commit:\n#   (use \"git add ...\" to update what will be committed)\n#   (use \"git checkout -- ...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n#       modified: CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nIt tells you pretty explicitly how to discard the changes you’ve made. Let’s do what it says:\n$ git checkout -- CONTRIBUTING.md\n$ git status\n# On branch main\n# Changes to be committed:\n#   (use \"git reset HEAD ...\" to unstage)\n#       renamed: README.md -> README\n\nYou can see that the changes have been reverted.\nIt’s important to understand that git checkout --  is a dangerous command.\nAny local changes you made to that file are gone — Git just replaced that file with\nthe last staged or committed version. Don’t ever use this command unless you\nabsolutely know that you don’t want those unsaved local changes.\n\nRemember, anything that is committed in Git can almost always be recovered. Even commits that\nwere on branches that were deleted or commits that were overwritten with an --amend commit can\nbe recovered. However, anything you lose that was never\ncommitted is likely never to be seen again.\n\nIf you would like to keep the changes you’ve made to that file but still need to get it out of the way\nfor now, there is a better command git stash:\nGit stash is a very useful command, where git will 'hide' the changes on a dirty directory - but no worries you can re-apply them later. The command will save your local changes away and revert the working directory to match the HEAD commit.\n# Stash local changes\n$ git stash\n\n# Stash local changes with a custom message\n$ git stash save \"this is your custom message\"\n\n# Re-apply the changes you saved in your latest stash\n$ git stash apply\n\n# Re-apply the changes you saved in a given stash number\n$ git stash apply stash@{stash_number}\n\n# Drops any stash by its number\n$ git stash drop stash@{0}\n\n# Apply the stash and then immediately drop it from your stack\n$ git stash pop\n\n# 'Release' a particular stash from your list of stashes\n$ git stash pop stash@{stash_number}\n\n# List all stashes\n$ git stash list\n\n# Show the latest stash changes\n$ git stash show\n\n# See diff details of a given stash number\n$ git diff stash@{0}\n\nGit version 2.23.0 introduced a new command: git restore. It’s basically an alternative to git reset\nwhich we just covered. From Git version 2.23.0 onwards, Git will use git restore instead of git\nreset for many undo operations.\nBranching and Merging\n# Creating a local branch\n$ git checkout -b branchname\n\n# Switching between 2 branches (in fact, this would work on terminal as well to switch between 2 directories - $ cd -)\n$ git checkout -\n\n# Pushing local branch to remote\n$ git push -u origin branchname\n\n# Deleting a local branch - this won't let you delete a branch that hasn't been merged yet\n$ git branch -d branchname\n\n# Deleting a local branch - this WILL delete a branch even if it hasn't been merged yet!\n$ git branch -D branchname\n\n# Remove any remote refs you have locally that have been removed from your remote (you can substitute  to any remote branch)\n$ git remote prune origin\n\n# Viewing all branches, including local and remote branches\n$ git branch -a\n\n# Viewing all branches that have been merged into your current branch, including local and remote\n$ git branch -a --merged\n\n# Viewing all branches that haven't been merged into your current branch, including local and remote\n$ git branch -a --no-merged\n\n# Viewing local branches\n$ git branch\n\n# Viewing remote branches\n$ git branch -r\n\nFetching and Checking Out Remote Branches\n# This will fetch all the remote branches for you.\n$ git fetch origin\n\n# With the remote branches in hand, you now need to check out the branch you are interested in, giving you a local working copy:\n$ git checkout -b test origin/test\n\n# Deleting a remote branch\n$ git branch -rd origin/branchname\n$ git push origin --delete branchname  or  $ git push origin:branchname\n\nMerging branch to main\n# First checkout main\n$ git checkout main\n\n# Now merge branch to main\n$ git merge main\n\n# To cancel a merge\n$ git merge --abort\n\nUpdating a local repository with changes from a Github repository\n$ git pull origin main\n\nTracking existing branch\n$ git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/foo foo\n\nGit remote\n# Show where 'origin' is pointing to and also tracked branches\n$ git remote show origin\n\n# Show where 'upstream' is pointing to and also tracked branches\n$ git remote show upstream\n\n# Show where 'origin' or 'upstream' is pointing to\n$ git remote -v\n\n# Change the 'origin' remote's URL\n$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/repo.git\n\n# Add a new remote\n# Usually use to 'rebase' from forks\n$ git remote add [NAME] https://github.com/user/fork-repo.git\n\nGit grep\n# 'Searches' for parts of strings in a directory\n$ git grep 'something'\n\n# 'Searches' for parts of strings in a directory and the -n prints out the line numbers where git has found matches\n$ git grep -n 'something'\n\n# 'Searches' for parts of string in a context (some lines before and some after the grepped term)\n$ git grep -C 'something'\n\n# 'Searches' for parts of string and also shows lines BEFORE the grepped term\n$ git grep -B 'something'\n\n# 'Searches' for parts of string and also shows lines AFTER the grepped term\n$ git grep -A 'something'\n\nGit blame\n# Show alteration history of a file with the name of the author\n$ git blame [filename]\n\n# Show alteration history of a file with the name of the author && SHA\n$ git blame [filename] -l\n\nUseful commands\n# Check if a sha is in production\n$ git tag --contains [sha]\n\n# Number of commits by author\n$ git shortlog -s --author 'Author Name'\n\n# List of authors and commits to a repository sorted alphabetically\n$ git shortlog -s -n\n\n# List of commit comments by author\n$ git shortlog -n --author 'Author Name'\n# This also shows the total number of commits by the author\n\n# Number of commits by contributors\n$ git shortlog -s -n\n\n# Undo local changes to a File\n$ git checkout -- filename\n\n# Shows more detailed info about a commit\n$ git cat-file sha -p\n\n# Show number of lines added and removed from a repository by an author since some time in the past.\n$ git log --author=\"Author name\" --pretty=tformat: --numstat --since=month | awk '{ add += $1;

However, as you don’t have BankID yet you won’t be able to pay for it. If you call Folksam you can arrange that they send you an invoice for 3 months, which should cover the amount of time until you get BankID to register your Swedish bank account. You could also wait until you have BankID but that may take a while.  \n\nRegister your foreign bank account at Swedbank Malmö to receive your salary.  \n\nCan be done using coordination number but using personal number will save you another visit to Swedbank later on.  \n\nApply for Swedish ID card (visit office in Malmö). \n\nRemember to take your Skatteverket documents concerning your personal number and passport! \n\nAppointments are made online and requires online payment.

This can take up to 6 months. During this time, you’ll covered by Swedish health insurance within the Nordic countries, not outside.  \n\nSet up home insurance*  \n\nWith a Swedish phone number, you can get Swish etc. \n\n\nSetting up a bank account\nFor Lund University members, it is advisable to open a bank account with Swedbank, which is the official bank for salary payments. You can do this at one of Swedbank’s branches or a bank in the Sparbanken group, but it is more advisable to visit a Swedbank office. To open the account, you will need your personal number (personnummer). Some bank representatives might allow you to open an account with your coordination number, but you won't have access to all bank services (like BankID).  \nTo open your bank account, you will need to provide your passport (and visa if applicable), the document from Skatteverket containing your personal number and the university contract. The account might be opened immediately, or you may be asked to fill out an application and come back in two weeks after receiving an SMS notification that your file is ready. Once the bank account is open, the bank representative will link it to your Lund University employment for salary deposits. For this to work, it is important to make sure that your employment is linked to your personal number (and not your coordination number which is the case when you arrive in Lund). \nAlongside the bank's assistance, you can contact HR person Herbert Floria to avoid any potential delays or issues with the account setup. \nIf you have a foreign bank account \nIf you have a coordination number, you can visit Swedbank in Malmö to inform them about your foreign bank account, to have your salary transferred there. When you go, make sure to bring a copy of your employment contract, your passport, and the registration form (ask HR) including the Lunds Universitets Salary Payment agreement number. When you receive your Swedish bank account, you should be able to change it online using BankID. Note that if you register your foreign account with your coordination number, you need to go to Swedbank again to register it with your personal number as soon as you get it otherwise your Lund account is not connected to your salary. If you apply for your personal number as soon as you're in Sweden (takes about 2 weeks), it may be better to register your foreign account with a personal number.  \nJC/PT sign up\nTo get on the journal club and power talk lists, see the document “JC + PT” in this folder \nTo sum up: \nYou do the sign up for each semester via Teams (see Teams Channel Journal Club & Powertalk) \nAs a full time PhD students/postdoc, you should sign up for 2-3 JC’s and PTs; as a senior researcher, you should sign up for one slot each \nPrimula and other staff webpages\nAll staff webpages can be reached from (https://www.medarbetarwebben.lu.se) in Swedish or  (https://www.staff.lu.se) in English. \nImportant shortcuts can be found on the right-hand side (Login shortcuts). \nPrimula is the system you need to log in to handle your employment/add information/ apply for vacation etc. \nWhen you click on the Primula link, you will need to scroll down to “Lund University”, click and then log in using your LUCAT. \nUnder “My page” you can find information regarding your employment, apply for vacation, apply for reimbursement, add personal data and information etc. \nUnder https://www.staff.lu.se you can also find links to TimeEdit (for room bookings), Kompetensportalen (for courses/educations offered by the university), KLARA (for chemicals) and LUCRIS (Research Portal where you can find information regarding LU researchers, publiscations, projects etc) and much more. \n"},"articles/chapter_3/receiving_new_members.html":{"url":"articles/chapter_3/receiving_new_members.html","title":"3.1 Receiving New Members","keywords":"","body":"Welcoming new members\nThis information is for welcoming new members to the team. \n\nSend out email to both DeMON and BioFinder email lists to let everyone know and that the new person can feel welcomed when they arrive.

If you are not familiar with git workflow, you are highly recommended to check Chapter 1.1 for more details. You should edit contents on a new branch, add your changes and commit your changes.\nClone repo locally\n\nYou could clone DeMONWiki repo to your local machine using git clone git@github.com:DeMONLab-BioFINDER/DeMONWiki.git. If you are working on a Windows machine, you might need to install git bash following Chapter 1.1.\nOnce you have cloned DeMONWiki on your local machine, you could run cd DeMONWiki to enter DeMONWiki directory.\nCreate a new branch\n\nFor easy tracking, you are required to edit on other branches instead of on main branch. You could run git branch to check how many branches are available.\nIf you want to create a new branch, you could run git checkout -b .\nEdit\n\nThe DeMONWiki is powered by the Gitbook service, which means all documents are in form of MarkDown format. If you are not familiar with MarkDown format, you could refer here for MarkDown usage.\nA Preview mode will be very helpful for editing MarkDown files, there are many tools, for example, VS Code.\nAdd & commit\n\nOnce you have edited the contents locally, you are ready to submit all your changes.\nYou could check the status of current branch by git status command.\nIf you are satisfied with all your changes, you will need to run git add . command to add these changes, then run git commit -m  to commit changes.\n3. Submit Pull Request (PR)\n\nIf you have added and committed all your changes, you are ready to push your commits to the remote repo by running git push origin .\nIf succeed, you will see the updated  branch on GitHub page (remote repo).\nTo make the changed you made merge into main branch, a PR is expected. You could got to Pull Request tab and click submit a new PR. You will need to ask DeMON labmates to review your PR.\n4. Review & merge your PR\n\nThe purpose of PR is multi-fold. The main reason is that to protect changes from untrusted parties given DeMONWiki is a public repo. Only authorized DeMON labmates could merge a PR. Another reason is to improve the quality of DeMONWiki.\nPR review\n\nAs a reviewer, you should keep in mind that the DeMONWiki should be detailed for new DeMON members as much as possible. For example, are the instructions intuitive for new DeMON members with diverse backgrounds? If text is not informative, should figures be provided? Are there any\nWhen you review the PR, you could help improve the quality by finding typos, bugs, grammar mistakes etc.\nOnce all comments from reviewers have been solved, the PR could be merged into main branch.\nBugs and questions\n\nIf you have any questions or find any bugs for this page, you could check with Lijun (anlijuncn@gmail.com)\n"}}}
