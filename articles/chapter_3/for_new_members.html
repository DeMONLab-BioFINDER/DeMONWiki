If you call Folksam you can arrange that they send you an invoice for 3 months, which should cover the amount of time until you get BankID to register your Swedish bank account. You could also wait until you have BankID but that may take a while.  </p>

<h2 id="setting-up-a-bank-account">Setting up a bank account</h2>
<p>For Lund University members, it is advisable to open a bank account with Swedbank, which is the official bank for salary payments. You can do this at one of Swedbank&#x2019;s branches or a bank in the Sparbanken group, but it is more advisable to visit a Swedbank office. To open the account, you will need your personal number (personnummer). Some bank representatives might allow you to open an account with your coordination number, but you won&apos;t have access to all bank services (like BankID).  </p>
<p>To open your bank account, you will need to provide your passport (and visa if applicable), the document from Skatteverket containing your personal number and the university contract. The account might be opened immediately, or you may be asked to fill out an application and come back in two weeks after receiving an SMS notification that your file is ready. Once the bank account is open, the bank representative will link it to your Lund University employment for salary deposits. For this to work, it is important to make sure that your employment is linked to your personal number (and not your coordination number which is the case when you arrive in Lund). </p>
<p>Alongside the bank&apos;s assistance, you can contact HR person Herbert Floria to avoid any potential delays or issues with the account setup. </p>
<p>If you have a foreign bank account </p>
<p>If you have a coordination number, you can visit Swedbank in Malm&#xF6; to inform them about your foreign bank account, to have your salary transferred there. When you go, make sure to bring a copy of your employment contract, your passport, and the registration form (ask HR) including the Lunds Universitets Salary Payment agreement number. When you receive your Swedish bank account, you should be able to change it online using BankID. Note that if you register your foreign account with your coordination number, you need to go to Swedbank again to register it with your personal number as soon as you get it otherwise your Lund account is not connected to your salary. If you apply for your personal number as soon as you&apos;re in Sweden (takes about 2 weeks), it may be better to register your foreign account with a personal number.  </p>
