Lupin home page:

Each large icon leads to a page with information how to perform each task.

Purchase (top left) leads you to page where you can look for things to purchase, then just it up and purchase. Can find _almost_ everything, but there are few exceptional cases, which will be mentioned later.

## Purchasing

### 1. Find the goods
After searching what you need, just add the goods to the cart, and then press continue to check-out (classic online shopping moves).

### Free-form requisition
Sometimes you may need something _very specific_ that you just can't find in the normal Lupin store. In such a case you may need to find the item online and then request it to be purchased via freetext form.

#### Case:
Purchasing Data storage server, found a specific one we liked on Dustin webstore, but not in the Lupin system.

Looked up dustin fritext in the purchasing page

And send in as a requisition.

In there once you get the invoice (for example for travel booking hotel, flights etc.) you will need to enter the activity code and accept the invoice.

# MED IT purchasing

Some of the more common things can be purchased much faster and without having to go through a Lupin/Proceedo hassle just via MED IT support page ([link](https://it.med.lu.se))
