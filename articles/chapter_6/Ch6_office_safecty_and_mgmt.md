# Office safety and mgmt
---

This information applies for the office in C11:

1. Everyone should know that there are safety equipment in the halls:
  1. Fire:
      - There is a fire extinguisher is located right next to the copying room, opposite the meeting room
      - There is a manual fire alarm right outside our office
      - Read up on what to do in case of fire: https://www.staff.lu.se/support-and-tools/security/case-fire
      - In short: Be prepared, rescue (people in immediate danger), warn (people around you), alert (the authorities, call 112), extinguish (if you can), evacuate
  2. First aid:
      - There is a first aid kit down the hall to the right if you are walking from the kitchen. It is just next to the first door on the left.
      - There is a heart starter in the main stairwell of BMC C, our floor. Just to the right if you go out in the stairwell from the floor.
2. Everyone should also know how to handle waste and recycling:
    - Most normal recycling can be done in the kitchen.
    - Larger trash such as boxes from monitors etc. can be recycled down in the culverts (i.e. the underground corridors). Go to the bottom om the stairwell just next to our office, walk through the door that says "larmed, use key button" (or something). Then take to the left and walk for ~40 meters or so
