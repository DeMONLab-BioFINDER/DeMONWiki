### Book flights 

Quite straightforward, find a flight that suits you best and select it.

___NOTE:___ pay attention to:
- Are the tickets refundable or not (sometimes they automatically suggest you buy refundable tickets which are significantly more expensive) This often shows up in step 3 "Select Fare"
- Do the tickets include baggage or not (often it does, but if it doesn't you can always add it on as an extra for a price)

### Book trains
Do not recommend for international travel (may be a bit tricky), but is great for travel within Sweden.
Booking process almost identical to flights booking.

### Book hotels

Again, just select where to go and dates, press Search

And you will get either a list or a Map view of the hotels, select the most optimal one.

At Step 3 "Select Room" you will be most likely given at least two room options, with completely identical descriptions of what you get, but different prices, usually because of different cancellation policies.

Then just continue onwards to the booking.


# Points of contact 
Email BCD.travel if you have any questions. If there's any issues with accessing the system and what not, they can usually book the trip for you as well if that's something that you need.
